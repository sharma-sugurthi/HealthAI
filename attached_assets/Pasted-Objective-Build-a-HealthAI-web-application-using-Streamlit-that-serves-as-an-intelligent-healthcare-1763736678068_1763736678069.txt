Objective:
Build a HealthAI web application using Streamlit that serves as an intelligent healthcare assistant. The app will leverage Google's Gemini Pro (or another high-quality free model) to provide accurate, reliable, and context-aware medical assistance.

🔹 Core Features to Implement
User Authentication
Secure login/registration with bcrypt password hashing.
Collect: username, password, full_name, age, gender.
Session management to keep users logged in.
AI-Powered Features
Patient Chat: Real-time Q&A with Gemini Pro for health-related queries.
Symptom Checker: Input symptoms → AI suggests possible conditions.
Treatment Plans: Generate and save AI-recommended health plans.
Health Analytics: Track and visualize health metrics (heart rate, BP, glucose, etc.) with Plotly charts.
Database (SQLite + SQLAlchemy)
Store user data, chat history, treatment plans, and health metrics.
Ensure data persistence across sessions.
UI/UX
Clean, intuitive design with a sidebar navigation.
Responsive layout for all devices.
Clear disclaimers about AI limitations (not a substitute for professional medical advice).
🔹 AI Model Requirements
Primary Model: Google Gemini Pro (via API)
Use google-generativeai library.
Handle API errors gracefully (e.g., rate limits, safety filters).
Ensure low latency for real-time interactions.
Fallback Option (if Gemini Pro is unavailable):
Use OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo (free tier) or another open-weight model like Llama 3 (via Ollama).
🔹 Technical Stack
plaintext
- Backend: Python 3.10+ with Streamlit
- AI: Google Gemini Pro (or fallback)
- Database: SQLite + SQLAlchemy
- Visualization: Plotly + Kaleido (for PDF exports)
- Authentication: bcrypt
- Deployment: Replit (ensure compatibility)
🔹 Example Code Structure

🔹 Key Instructions for Replit Agent
Prioritize accuracy and reliability in AI responses.
Handle API errors gracefully (e.g., retries, fallback models).
Optimize for speed—avoid unnecessary API calls.
Ensure security:
Never hardcode API keys (use 
.env
).
Hash passwords with bcrypt.
Test thoroughly before finalizing.
